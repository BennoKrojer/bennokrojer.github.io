    <h1>Fear of Failure</h1>

I've been much in my head lately, and was not really present in my life when doing fun things, ruminating instead. So tonight, after another one of those days, I sat down and wrote down my feelings: <br><br>

It is time to fail. <br>
I have never failed much in my life. <br>
Sometimes I gave up before it could get too bad. I gave up for good reasons back then, like when studying math. <br>
I never really gave up with frisbee, but just other things got more important in life over the years. <br>
But now with the professor thing. <br>
I kind of want it. <br>
And the only reason not to try is fear. <br>
Fear of failure. <br>
Fear of rejection. <br>
Fear of future stress and hardship, too. <br>
Of burn out. <br>
That last one is a valid one I guess. <br>
I think it is time, for the first time in my life in a way, to attempt something where I have a realistic chance of failure. <br>
Where there is real uncertainty. <br>
In the past I often tried things where I was quite sure it would work out. <br>
Making certain sports teams. <br>
Getting into some PhD programs. <br>
Never got a paper so far rejected from a conference. <br>
I came in well-prepared. <br>
And I will come in well-prepared here too. <br>
But the inherent uncertainty and competitive nature means being prepared and just good, might not be good enough. <br>
And that is scary. <br>
But it is more important that I do things in life where I can fail. <br>
Bold things, new things, facing my inner demons more heads on. <br>
I will not give up. <br>
I can persist through these harder times of questioning myself. <br>
And I will be kind to myself, and most importantly others, while doing so. <br>
I will persist but toughness and numbness is not the only way to persist through hardship. <br>
Gentleness too. <br>
That is a big fear too, on top of fear of failure or burn out. <br>
The fear of what this pursuit will do to my character and soul. <br>
I sometimes see more senior people who have lost their kindness. <br>
Who rush through life. <br>
Who cannot see other ways of living anymore. <br>
And I know I have a tendency for that. <br>
This might be the only legitimate reason for me to call it off when I am on the job market. <br>
If I can sense that I cannot resist the forces and incentives around me. <br>
It is related to the fear of burn out for sure. <br>
It is why I almost quit my PhD at the end of first year. <br>
But I have learned that it does not always take drastic measures. <br>
Sometimes a shorter break. <br>
And more importantly, a routine of continuous breaks and playfulness. <br>
I do not get scientists frankly that are not playful anymore. <br>
Playfulness is so tied to genuine curiosity for me. <br>
And that is at the heart of being a scientist. <br>
I know why it happens that one loses this, so I get that. <br>
But I do not get why they do not try with all means to get it back. <br>
