    <h1>Fear of Failure</h1>

I've been much in my head lately, and was not really present in my life when doing fun things, ruminating instead. So tonight, after another one of those days, I sat down and wrote down my feelings:

It is time to fail.
I have never failed much in my life.
Sometimes I gave up before it could get too bad. I gave up for good reasons back then, like when studying math.
I never really gave up with frisbee, but just other things got more important in life over the years.
But now with the professor thing.
I kind of want it.
And the only reason not to try is fear.
Fear of failure.
Fear of rejection.
Fear of future stress and hardship, too.
Of burn out.
That last one is a valid one I guess.
I think it is time, for the first time in my life in a way, to attempt something where I have a realistic chance of failure.
Where there is real uncertainty.
In the past I often tried things where I was quite sure it would work out.
Making certain sports teams.
Getting into some PhD programs.
Never got a paper so far rejected from a conference.
I came in well-prepared.
And I will come in well-prepared here too.
But the inherent uncertainty and competitive nature means being prepared and just good, might not be good enough.
And that is scary.
But it is more important that I do things in life where I can fail.
Bold things, new things, facing my inner demons more heads on.
I will not give up.
I can persist through these harder times of questioning myself.
And I will be kind to myself, and most importantly others, while doing so.
I will persist but toughness and numbness is not the only way to persist through hardship.
Gentleness too.
That is a big fear too, on top of fear of failure or burn out.
The fear of what this pursuit will do to my character and soul.
I sometimes see more senior people who have lost their kindness.
Who rush through life.
Who cannot see other ways of living anymore.
And I know I have a tendency for that.
This might be the only legitimate reason for me to call it off when I am on the job market.
If I can sense that I cannot resist the forces and incentives around me.
It is related to the fear of burn out for sure.
It is why I almost quit my PhD at the end of first year.
But I have learned that it does not always take drastic measures.
Sometimes a shorter break.
And more importantly, a routine of continuous breaks and playfulness.
I do not get scientists frankly that are not playful anymore.
Playfulness is so tied to genuine curiosity for me.
And that is at the heart of being a scientist.
I know why it happens that one loses this, so I get that.
But I do not get why they do not try with all means to get it back.
