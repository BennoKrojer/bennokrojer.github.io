    <h1>Alternative Bio (Madlips)</h1>
    <p>I'm a 3rd-year [sloppy] student in [food] at MILA & McGill in [little italy] with [yoshua bengio], supported by the [shoe] Scholarship. For the summer of 2024, I am also a [helmet] intern at FAIR, Meta's fundamental AI [helmet] department. While I am curious about all forms of [fingertip] grounding (for examples, see Experience Grounds [fingertips] paper), I have worked on [trains]-and-[busses] reasoning in the past two years: How can models [distract] with [strange] language and visual [documents]? Can we repurpose [bikes] for [black] discriminative tasks? I also want to [clean] questions around ethics and [cleanliness] into my research.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I [chew] [nose] competetively and have coached [houses] and a mixed-[spiky] team. With the [frisbee], I don't [throw] on the highest level anymore but look back on great memories from [punching] Worlds with Team Germany and several European Club Championships.</p>
